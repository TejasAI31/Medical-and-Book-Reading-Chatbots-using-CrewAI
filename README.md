# Medical-and-Book-Reading-Chatbots-using-CrewAI
The Medical Chatbot consists of multiple simple Agenta with a Gemini-1.5-flash. These agents will sequentially come to a explanation about the given medical condition.

The Book Reader Chatbot consists of a pair of Agentic Rag models that will read two pdf's of the same book (one less detailed, the other detailed), and answer the given question. This is to see how much the vastness of the vector database affects the agent's decision making.
